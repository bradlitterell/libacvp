     * "tc" is test_case->tc.ml_kem. All modes use tc->param_set to specify ML-KEM-512, 768, or 
     * 1024.
     *
     * For keygen, take tc->d and tc->z (seeds) and use them to generate tc->ek (encapsulation key)
     * and tc->dk (decapsulation key) as well as their _len values
     *
     * For encap/decap, AFT test types (tc->type) correspond to an encapsulate operation, and VAL
     * tests correspond to a decapsulate operation (you can also look at the tc->function value).
     *
     * For encapsulating, take tc->ek and tc->m (m being a given random value) and use them to
     * generate a shared secret (tc->k) and ciphertext (tc->c).
     *
     * For decapsulating, take tc->dk and tc->c and attempt to generate tc->k. Note that in the
     * case of invalid ciphertext being provided, the IuT is expected to still provide a k value
     * that aligns with the "implicit rejection" function described in FIPS203.
