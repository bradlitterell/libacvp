# Overview

This directory contains all of the code for an application that can run ACVP testing against
several different cryptographic implementations. For details about each supported implementation and
their harnesses, view the readmes in the "implementations" directory and its subdirectories.

Excluding the aforementioned implementations directory, this directory contains code that is common
to the application regardless of which implementation is being built and tested. This includes command
line parsing (app_cli.c), TOTP generation (the "totp" directory), and general flow of the software
(app_main.c), as well as various helper functions and headers. The general flow of the software calls into
implementation-specific code using the functions described in app/implementations/README.md.
